    "core": "In the city, buses are priority when they leave their stop, and all drivers must facilitate the passage at intersections and in the narrow streets. Moreover, it is advisable to be extra attentive to pedestrians who ride or disembarking there. Indeed, they regularly have to cross the roadway nearby. In the case of temporary stop, it is possible that users can be found directly on the road.<!img1.jpeg~www.openclassrooms.com!>When a bus is stopped and the line has a discontinuous pattern, other drivers can overcome them. Prudence, however, when preparing to leave off, because drivers no longer have the right to take the overflow processes.<!img2.jpeg~www.openclassrooms.com!>To facilitate the traffic conditions of transport, bus lanes have been created in urban areas. Traffic in a bus lane by a personal vehicle causes a 4th class ticket. The amount of the fines incurred is 90 € (minus fine) to 375 € (increased fine) .If it is forbidden to circulate, crossing bus lanes is permitted for other users provided that they respect the priority rules, which is good to know for candidates wishing to sit the practical exam permit conduire.Hors agglomeration, do not give way to a bus that wants to drive in traffic because speed is too high and it would increase the risk of collision with the rear of the vehicle. As each time a user is found in the presence of a heavy vehicle, it must be vigilant about their potential maneuvers.",
