In effect, that means you must give way to leading the right vehicles or roads on the right. You are therefore not prioritized. However, if you get that right for anyone else who sees this panel located on the shoulder and is concerned, it will give you pass because you are the priority.##Panel 2 and 3:#This sign indicates that you are on a priority road. The same striped panel ends the priority of the road on which you drive.##Panel 4:#This is a one-time priority and you just about if you go straight to next intersection and other road users must give you passage#The sign and road markings Stop#The vehicles on the road in front of this panel must always give way to other road users. In addition, the Stop comes with ground markings in the form of a continuous white line. This line should be crossed only after the user is satisfied that it can fit along the way, this by checking if other priority drivers traveling or not on track.<!img3.jpeg~www.openclassrooms.com!>#The panel and the markings of the give-way#Unlike the stop sign, the c\u00e9dezlepassage panels do not require the vehicle to stop. However, in the presence of some plaques, it is possible that c\u00e9dezlepassage panel be established to prevent users that they will soon encounter a STOP sign.<!img4.jpeg~www.openclassrooms.com!>",
